# Educational project about Data Science
We're gonna implement an example Data Science project using Airbnb website as a data source.

Current plan is the following:

1) Scrape some listings from a particular location
2) Explore and clean the data set
3) Build a machine learning model for listing price prediction
4) Explore the results: metrics, prediction errors. Think of some use cases to apply the model.
